# Base46

> You could say 16 colors is enough, and yeah, it is enough.
> However, more is more.
> The more, the better.
> That is why we decided that 46 colors is perfect.

### Set Theme

- `base`: (type string) The amount of colors you want in your theme ("base16" for 16 colors | "base46" for 46 colors).
- `theme`: (type string) The name of the theme you desire. You can find out what themes are available by going into `./lua/base46/hl_themes/`.
- `transparency`: (type bool) Do you want transparency or not?
 
```lua
-- exit if it can't be found
local present, base46 = pcall(require, "base46")
if not present then
	return
end

local theme = "gruvchad"
local color_base = "base46"

local theme_opts = {
	base = color_base,
	theme = theme,
	transparency = false,
}

base46.load_theme(theme_opts)
```

## Contribute Themes

- Themes are placed in the `./lua/base46/hl_themes/` directory.
- To create a new theme, create a lua file with the name of the theme you want it to be (the file name should be all lowercase for the sake of consistency).
- All colors in the theme must be in a `#RRGGBB` hex  code format.
